        Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) RESTful Transport
                   draft-epp-restful-transport-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies a 'RESTful interface for EPP' (REPP) with the
   aim to improve efficiency and interoperability of EPP systems.

   This document includes a new EPP Protocol Extension as well as a
   mapping of [RFC5730] XML-commands to an HTTP based (RESTful)
   interface.  Existing semantics and mappings as defined in [RFC5731],
   [RFC5732] and [RFC5733] are largely retained and reusable in RESTful
   EPP.

   With REPP, no session is created on the EPP server.  Each request
   from client to server will contain all of the information necessary
   to understand the request.  The server will close the connection
   after each HTTP request.
